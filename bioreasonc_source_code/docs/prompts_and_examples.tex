\subsubsection{Generation Prompt Templates}

\paragraph{S-SNP-COUNT Template:}
Evaluates understanding of genetic variant support for gene-disease associations.

\begin{verbatim}
PROMPT: "Evaluate the robustness of the {gene}-{disease} association
        based on supporting genetic variants."

ANSWER TEMPLATE (Reasoning):
Step 1: Count supporting variants - {snp_count} total SNPs,
        {unique_snps} unique.
Step 2: Assess independence - Multiple independent signals suggest
        true association.
Step 3: Consider LD structure - Considering LD structure, {unique_snps}
        unique variants from {snp_count} total SNPs suggest multiple
        causal variants.
Step 4: Evaluate effect sizes - Effect sizes are typical for complex
        trait associations.
Step 5: Check replication - {replication_status}.
Conclusion: The {gene}-{disease} association is {robustness} based on
            {snp_count} supporting SNPs with {unique_snps} unique variants.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
Step 1: Count supporting variants - 30 total SNPs, 30 unique.
Step 2: Assess independence - Multiple independent signals suggest
        true association.
Step 3: Consider LD structure - Considering LD structure, 30 unique
        variants from 30 total SNPs suggest multiple causal variants.
Step 4: Evaluate effect sizes - Effect sizes are typical for complex
        trait associations.
Step 5: Check replication - Partially replicated.
Conclusion: The DHRS7C-Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 association is

\subsubsection{Generation Prompt Templates}

\paragraph{C-CAUSAL-VS-ASSOC Template:}
The \textbf{core} template for distinguishing association from causation.

\begin{verbatim}
PROMPT: "Is the relationship between {gene} and {disease} causal or
        associative based on GWAS evidence?"

ANSWER TEMPLATE (CoT):
The relationship is ASSOCIATIVE, not causal.

**Step 1 - Evidence Type:**
GWAS provides statistical association (OR={or_value}, p={p_value}).

**Step 2 - Causal Limitation:**
GWAS identifies correlation but CANNOT prove causation due to:
- Potential confounding variables
- Possible reverse causation
- Linkage disequilibrium with true causal variant

**Step 3 - Required Evidence for Causality:**
- Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis
- Functional studies showing biological mechanism
- Intervention trials

**Step 4 - Conclusion:**
Based on GWAS alone, we can only say {gene} is ASSOCIATED with
{disease}, not that it CAUSES {disease}.
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{C-MR-EVIDENCE Template:}
Evaluates interpretation of Mendelian Randomization evidence.

\begin{verbatim}
PROMPT: "Based on Mendelian Randomization analysis, can we infer that
        {gene} causally affects {disease}? Explain your reasoning."

ANSWER TEMPLATE (CoT):
Step 1: Understand MR methodology - MR uses genetic variants as
        natural experiments to test causation.
Step 2: Examine MR score - {gene} has an MR score of {mr_score}.
Step 3: Interpret the score - [Strong/Moderate/Insufficient] MR support
        provides causal evidence through natural genetic randomization.
Step 4: Consider MR assumptions - Relevance, independence,
        exclusion restriction.
Step 5: Assess potential violations - [Assessment].
Conclusion: [supports/does not support] a causal relationship.
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{C-CAUSAL-STRENGTH Template:}
Distinguishes association from causation with evidence evaluation.

\begin{verbatim}
PROMPT: "Evaluate whether the evidence supports a causal role for {gene}
        in {disease}. Distinguish between association and causation."

ANSWER TEMPLATE (CoT):
Step 1: Define association vs causation - Association shows correlation;
        causation requires evidence the gene directly affects disease risk.
Step 2: Review associative evidence - {snp_count} GWAS SNPs,
        risk score {risk_score}.
Step 3: Examine causal evidence - Causal confidence: {causal_score},
        MR score: {mr_score}.
Step 4: Apply causal criteria - [Assessment of criteria].
Step 5: Consider confounding - MR design reduces confounding.
Conclusion: Evidence [supports/does not support] a causal role.
\end{verbatim}

        {evidence_level} evidence.
Step 2: Examine GWAS support - {snp_count} SNPs support this association.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Causal Language Discipline}: C taxonomy questions enforce strict distinction between ``associated with'' (GWAS) and ``causes'' (MR-validated).

    \item \textbf{Evidence Grounding}: All answers include specific scores (MR score, risk score, GO score) from the knowledge graph.

    \item \textbf{Step-by-Step Reasoning}: Reasoning format answers follow a structured 4-5 step CoT template.

    \item \textbf{Uncertainty Quantification}: Conclusions reflect evidence strength (``very strong'', ``moderate'', ``weak'').

    \item \textbf{Reproducibility}: Each question links to source data with gene IDs, disease IDs, and evidence descriptions.
