KCNJ11 variants show OR of 1.15, supported by 1 associated SNPs. This is a modest effect, typical of most GWAS findings. Common variants generally have small individual effects that combine additively in polygenic risk.\n\nWhy does KCNJ11 affect Type 2 Diabetes risk? KCNJ11 encodes a protein with functions relevant to disease pathophysiology. The biological mechanism involves insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and progressive beta cell dysfunction, leading to impaired glucose homeostasis.\n\nFor individual risk interpretation: an OR of 1.15 means carriers have 1.15x the odds of developing Type 2 Diabetes compared to non-carriers. However, it's important to note that OR describes relative risk\u2014the absolute risk increase depends on baseline population risk. For most people, lifestyle factors (diet, exercise, environmental exposures) may have larger absolute effects on their Type 2 Diabetes risk than any single genetic variant.",

The association is robust: OR of 1.13, replicated across studies. But association is not causation.\n\nConsider the alternatives:\n\n**Confounding:** Perhaps HHEX variants are more common in populations with lifestyle factors that independently increase Type 2 Diabetes risk. The association would be real but not causal.\n\n**Linkage disequilibrium:** The associated variant might simply tag the true causal variant nearby. HHEX could span a large genomic region; the causal variant could be in a regulatory element affecting a different gene entirely.\n\n**Reverse causation:** Less likely for germline variants, but disease-related metabolic changes could theoretically affect HHEX regulation.\n\nHHEX encodes a protein with functions relevant to disease pathophysiology. The biological pathway to Type 2 Diabetes involves insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and progressive beta cell dysfunction, leading to impaired glucose homeostasis.\n\nThe correct statement is: \"HHEX variants are associated with increased Type 2 Diabetes risk.\" Claiming causation requires MR, functional studies, or ideally both.",
